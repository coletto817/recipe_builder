   Steps to start building

Thinking process

1. How would I like the app to be written in the most convenience way for chef?
2. Plan the layout of the webpage
3. create repository on GitHub
4. Build the basic structure of the project on VS code with html structure
5. introduce Js to the button
6. when finished, style the project with css and make it responsive

Problem 1

1. at the beginning, I focus a lot on achieving the UI design and Js at the same time, I soon noticed that I have spread out my attention across different problems at the same time.
2. so I took a break and start fresh, breaking up the bigger problem into smaller problem.
3. Focusing one problem at a time
4. Check past project and see if there's reusable codes that I can use
5. Revise the basic / foundation in order to be comfortable again in writing DOM

problem 2

1. trying to seperate the ingredients into a list
2. AppendChild?
3. show the ideal way
